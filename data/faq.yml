  - question: "Q. Is my staked LUNA secure?"
    answer: >
            Even if your LUNA is staked, it is still managed by you and we cannot access it.
            To ensure it's safe, store it on an offline or hardware wallet, 
            like [Ledger](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017698979-Terra-LUNA-?docs=true).
